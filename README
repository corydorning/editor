 What is it?
----------------------
'editor' is a simple project, that really isn't a project at all. It
is simply a collection of my text editor settings so I can easily access
them from anywhere, at anytime.


Feel free to use them all you want. The perspective of the settings is
that of a front-end developer.


Color Schemes & Themes
-----------------------
In addition to storing my settings for text editors here, I have also
stripped out custom themes that I have written/modified for each them.

Special attention has been paid to HTML, CSS and JavaScript, so if using
a different language/technology, ymmv.
